## setup
`conda env create -f environment.yml
`
#todo:
# PERSPECTIVE_API_KEY = os.getenv("PERSPECTIVE_API")

CultureBank pipeline execution
1.1 running cultural relevenace classifier (provide one model, the reddit one?)
1.2 extraction (provide the fine-tuned mixtral model, the reddit one?) #ryan
2.1 clustering (with default parameters, TODO: need to add time range)
2.2 cluster summarization (provide the fine-tuned mixtral model, the reddit one?) #ryan
2.3 topic normalization? #ryan
3.1 agreement calculator 
3.2 content moderation (perspective + provide the controversial one for tiktok + keywords)
3.3 final touch, PII information

## evaluation code (Ryan)
1. `evaluation/convert_to_desc.py`: concatenates the fields in culturebank data and translates them into paragraphs of cultural descriptions.
2. `evaluation/generate_questions.py`: generates questions for grounded evaluation based on the cultural descriptions.
3. `evaluation/generate_questions_aug.py`: generates questions for grounded evaluation based on the cultural descriptions with self-refinement method.
4. `evaluation/grounded_eval.py`: performs grounded evaluation on language models on the generated cultural questions.
5. `evaluation/knowledge_entailment.py`: computes the knowledge entailment scores of models in the grounded evaluations.
6. `evaluation/direct_eval.py`: performs direct evaluation on language models on CultureBank data.

## fine-tuning code (Ryan)
0. finetuning
1. cultureNLI eval
2. world value eval

# released model
1. extracgor
2. summarizer
3. question generator
4. culturally aware llm. 
CultureBank-extracgor
